# pipelines-project

First of all I tried to make a pipeline of a dataset about the happiness ratio in the world. It is an interesting topic but after analysing the data and "cleaning" it, I realized there is not much to "scrap" in the website. So I decided to change the topic to something more tangible or rather more countable like hotel customer rating.

I got a dataset from kaggle called ["Hotel Reviews"](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/hotel-reviews) of a bunch of reviews with rates from 2014 to 2017 of the US hotels.

My plan was to compare this data with the updated one and see how these customer's opinion has changed during these years. As the dataset is huge and the data scraping with the tools I have is limited I decided to reduce the sample to San Diego.

I web-scraped Booking.com, Tripadvisor and I did my best with Expedia. Expedia has a dynamic website so I had to learn how to use Selenium. Nonetheless I've been unable to get the data from Expedia...
